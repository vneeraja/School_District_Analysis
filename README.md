## Overview of the school district analysis

We will be helping maria, a chief Data Scientist for a city school district, to analyse data on student funding and students standardized test scores. We aggregate the data and showcase trends based on school performance.
Now, The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. 
Maria has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.
Once we have replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like us to repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
